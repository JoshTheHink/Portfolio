                        I've been passionate about both art and games for as long as I can remember—especially the intersection of how they can come together to further an artist's vision.

                        Growing up, my early experiences with carpentry sparked a deep appreciation for how individual details contribute to a cohesive whole. Something I now carry into all of my art as a Game Developer.

                        By high school, I was fully committed to pursuing a career in the industry. Since then, I have contributed to several collaborative projects through the Game Developers Club and MonRiverGames, creating visual assets and taking creative direction. Currently, I serve as the project lead and artist for Chumps Chained, a title in development with MonRiverGames.

Who, at this time, are the beautiful pill-shaped creatures depicted to the left, with arms being separately simulated. We knew we wanted high contrast from the players to the environment, while contrasting each other enough so that players can easily keep track of who they are.</p> 

<p>
    Our vision of the gameplay loop, however, intended to have friction and cause some levels of playful frustration, is meant to primarily be fair. We, and especially I, are advocates of difficult games, but see the trap in making a game unfair in order to artificially increase difficulty. Which is a trap we didn’t want to fall into.

                                <p>That’s why, as we worked on this initial prototype between work and getting ready to start our Junior year, we pitched it to our Professor’s Non-profit Organization, “MonRiverGames”. We got accepted and were able to enlist a programmer to help us over the summer, but more importantly. We would have a small team of students during the school year who are volunteering for class credit to help. While we still had to work on this outside of class. 

We always knew we wanted the chain physics to persist past the gameplay, so we created many drafts where we could implement the physics of the chain into UI elements, such as the pause screen. We envisioned this would help with charm and make the UI feel immediately readable as part of the game world and not isolated from it. Although this did take a while past August, it did work and had the intended result and more.

                                <p>As fellow students onboarded onto the project. We had to learn how to lead and coordinate a group of 11(13, including leads). 5 Computer Science students were part of a separate class that coordinated with 6 from our class of dedicated Game Design students. This meant leading the project and making sure tasks were assigned and doable. That we can put out fires, do our own programming and art, try our best to keep things on time; And the most difficult aspect, communicating with our team and making sure they communicate with each other. We had to use pictures of whiteboard sessions we had to visually communicate things like level design and mechanic design between classes. Words got too muddled at times. 

Which was rough at the beginning, the Computer Science students and Game Design students met at the same time but in different classrooms, and coordinating outside of class was very difficult. At times during this first semester, it felt like phantoms would make a project on the game from both classes' perspectives, thankfully mostly productive things, but still unknown phantoms. However, the biggest issue with learning how to communicate was balancing the difficulty of the game without using unnecessary frustration. It was worked on slowly during the summer, and it was mostly concept art and mechanics that didn’t work yet. Everyone new came into the project imagined something different, and it was hard to make those visions align with each other, let alone using them to enhance the original vision.

                                <p>This was the month that could have crushed and broken the project. I was out of commission for the entire first half of the month due to unforeseen health issues, and the communication errors kept adding up on a technical level; But we planned ahead and made some decisions prior that helped us immensely. First, the Co-Leader strategy worked as intended; a single person being out of a project shouldn’t halt progress. Secondly, we tried our best not just to lead but also to help create, so we can coordinate everything visually. 

Even if a lot of the art ended up being replaced soon after, the game is readable. We slowly built a library of references for artists on the team to help coordinate with each other, alongside more official guides. Even at this time, certain mechanics on a physical level were not working in the slightest and were causing issues. We at least had a coherent visual identity to keep development feeling smooth and giving us motivation to keep seeing where this game goes.

                                <p>However, this didn’t mean the game was perfectly visual; we had to take a few steps back before more work was done and cover color theory. The colors, although bright and pretty on the characters, weren’t color blind friendly. The foreground and background muddled together, and just generally didn’t feel right. We had to make concepts for a lot of the visuals and rethink colors. We also took this approach so we could divert manpower over to fixing the chain physics. Those that were working sometimes now were extremely buggy.

We discovered that with this game, we picked the one mechanic that makes programming a 2D platformer, from being the standard level of difficulty that comes with making a game, to an intimidating task. Any small change would brutalize our repository, as we had to fundamentally change how the chain worked with every change alongside the camera, so it could keep track of both players in a non-buggy fashion. This combination, along with organizing our aesthetics, made each build look and play differently every single week.

                                <p>As our semester was winding down and we had to prepare to offboard our Game Design students, we started playtesting. We had multiple solutions and ideas for how we wanted to go forward with the chain. Our original vision was to have the arms of the players be animated and simulated separately, wildly flailing around as the players made any movement. This created A LOT of problems, and we discovered through playtesting. That it really didn’t enhance the game, players didn’t seem to notice, and those who commented on it thought it was broken. It also muddled up our visual language, and players kept getting distracted by it and complaining about its supposed broken nature. 

We also, after a while in development, weren’t charmed by the visual either. We didn’t get anything from it, and it was pushing back our development. So we had to scrap that idea. Although it created delays, we felt animating and programming were much simpler from this point forward. We also knew we had something special on our hands. The playtests went successfully, people would ask engaged questions, and were communicating with each other as intended. It wasn’t perfect, not even close; But it was proof that a minimal prototype worked and we knew where to head.

We focused on this due to an upcoming event later that semester.

GDC 2025 was on its way, and a lot of the team, including me, were extremely excited but also nervous.

This allowed us to finally include our swing mechanic, where they have to balance on hanging surfaces with each other. It also allowed us to include things like pull, which can help with the swing gameplay, or be used to purposely frustrate the other player. We finally felt we had reached the simple mechanics with a wide variety of uses. Even if there were several bugs to fix, we had new clarity.

This, on top of the other project lead, Cadence being out of commission for health reasons for the whole month, led to us learning a lot about crunch time and figuring out what’s needed for a certain sprint and what’s not needed.

                                <p>Our UI came together in time for GDC, physically being simulated and falling when you pause the game. With our animation system being improved with a wider variety of animations that better track where the players were, and play a wider variety of animations using that context. We still had plenty of bugs, but we had fewer. So we had to use what we got and uploaded our first build onto Steam.

Our initial steam launch was made in order to give those who are interested the ability to track the project. It was an avenue for us to make connections with the studio as a whole, while making the game more public during this time. GDC went phenomenally, and we learned so much from the experience, to the point that the feedback and vision were overwhelming. It would take us months and months just to incorporate what we got from watching developers play and give feedback.

The game visually made sense, and the gameplay made sense. Everything that was in there is coherent. But players were confused as to why. Our focus wasn’t to create an intense story; however, we had a story planned that we feel greatly enhances the game. So we drafted out the idea of an animated opening comic that shows how the story begins and establishes what the art and gameplay are going to be like by emphasizing the chain and the personalities of Walter, Jellybean, and the world they inhabit. </p>

Which we considered a big victory, not just in terms of development, but showing our growth as leaders, most people who have worked on the project or are working on the project are doing it for class credit and portfolio credit. We felt this was proof that we had a game worth growing into its full potential, but more importantly, that we had grown enough as leaders and artists to adequately lead and foster a good working environment.</p>

Our vision was coherent enough that we felt everyone was much closer to being on the same page this time around, along with being able to onboard new programmers and artists in a way that didn’t feel daunting. The style guide is very defined, and our efforts to properly document for new programmers worked out. This gave us the chance to experiment with new mechanics, such as sticky walls and pigeons that attack the players, just to see what works and what sort of gameplay loop additions would benefit the game.</p>
