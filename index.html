                    <p>
                        I've been passionate about both art and games for as long as I can remember—especially the intersection of how they can come together to further an artist's vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, my early experiences with carpentry sparked a deep appreciation for how individual details contribute to a cohesive whole. Something I now carry into all of my art as a Game Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By high school, I was fully committed to pursuing a career in the industry. Since then, I have contributed to several collaborative projects through the Game Developers Club and MonRiverGames, creating visual assets and taking creative direction. Currently, I serve as the project lead and artist for Chumps Chained, a title in development with MonRiverGames.

                                    <li>Communication errors due to different classrooms were an issue, but I minimized them by leading by example and being directly involved in as much art and programming as possible. </li>
                                    <li>This, in tandem with an art iteration philosophy, helped make the game much more visually coherent. Even if we made art to look partially professional, we did it quickly. To see what visual language, like contrasts or silhouettes, needs improvement. </li>

The goal of this is to take what already works from the first step and use that to make an improved outline and color scheme that fits the project as a whole.</p>

If the asset is an animation, I do like to make a completed version through to step 3 for one of the frames before I go on to step 2 and 3 for the rest of the frames.
